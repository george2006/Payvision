First of all thank you for giving me this oportunity.
I have been following you a lot of time.

:)


I'm not an expert on algorithms, its difficult me, but i always got it working.

In the second exercise, i think that abstractions are discovered and not invented.
Taking this into account I have tried to get a good balance between flexibility and 
extensibility.

If you dont like something on my design i will really appreciate that you give me some indications
so i can improve my self

Best Regards.
Hope I see you soon!
